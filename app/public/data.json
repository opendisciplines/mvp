Herpes\u201d.\n- Dr. Morry acknowledged that it was plausible that he made a comment to the effect that the number of sexual partners the patient had was high in his personal view.\n- Dr. Morry also acknowledged that he failed to treat the patient with adequate sensitivity, respect, and dignity in relation to the discussion of the patient\u2019s sexual history and diagnosis.\n- The Tribunal found Dr. Morry\u2019s conduct was in violation of s. 4(oo) of the College\u2019s Code of Ethics which prohibits \u201cinappropriate comments or questions reflecting a lack of respect for  the  patient\u2019s  dignity  or  privacy\u201d.\n- The Tribunal found that his conduct amounted to conduct deserving of sanction as defined in the Medical Act, 2011.\n- Dr. Morry was reprimanded, ordered to provide a written apology to the patient, and complete a course on understanding boundaries and managing risks inherent in the doctor-patient relationship.\n- The decision and order of the Tribunal were published by the Registrar, and Dr. Morry was ordered to pay the costs of the College in the amount of $20,000.",

Conduct of this sort represents egregious breaches of the ethical and professional standards expected of a medical resident.\n- Lying to the College in the course of an investigation and providing false and misleading information to an academic institution constitutes professional misconduct and, if serious enough and\/or part of a pattern of behavior, can also demonstrate an unfitness to practice medicine.\n- It is a particularly egregious breach of ethical and moral standards for a physician to represent to others, including the physician's medical colleagues, that the physician has or had been diagnosed with a non-existent serious medical condition and has undergone or is undergoing treatment for that condition when neither is true in order to gain personal advantage. Such conduct is unbecoming a member of the medical profession.\n- Ms. Kehar altered an email she had received from the College before forwarding it to CPSS. This was an apparent attempt by Ms. Kehar to remedy the situation and to deflect responsibility for this error from herself onto the College.\n- Ms. Kehar provided false and misleading information to two separate professional regulatory authorities and an educational institution and in doing so, altered documents.\n- Ms. Kehar confirmed that between in or about December 2019 and July 2020, she lied to two of her medical colleagues about her personal circumstances, including the state of her health to garner sympathy and support.",

The document pertains to the disciplinary case of Dr. Corder, a medical practitioner whose license was revoked due to inappropriate relationships with patients.\n2. Dr. Corder had inappropriate relationships with two patients, referred to as Patient X and Patient Y. He used Patient X for sexual gratification and Patient Y for emotional support, both of which were deemed unacceptable.\n3. Dr. Corder's first application for reinstatement of his license was denied by the Executive Committee in December 2014. The Committee stated that they could not reinstate an individual whose fitness to practice medicine had not been established.\n4. In his current application for reinstatement, Dr. Corder stated that he would not consider long-term family practice situations in any location or in any circumstance. He also committed to long-term mentorship for himself and to continuing with long-term psychotherapy.\n5. The Investigation Committee opposed Dr. Corder\u2019s current application for reinstatement on several grounds. They argued that Dr. Corder has failed to demonstrate that it is in the public interest for him to be reinstated. His application focuses not on what is in the public interest, but rather on what is in Dr. Corder\u2019s interests.\n6. The document does not provide any specific information about a city or dollar value.\nHere are more detailed highlights of the document:\n1. Dr. Corder's first application for reinstatement of his license included conditions such as no house calls, only examining female patients with an attendant, and continuing psychotherapy. This application was denied by the Executive Committee in December 2014.\n2. In his current application for reinstatement, Dr. Corder has stated that he will not consider long-term family practice situations in any location or in any circumstance. He also committed to long-term mentorship for himself and to continuing with long-term psychotherapy.\n3. Several reports and assessments were conducted subsequent to the Investigation Committee\u2019s denial of Dr. Corder\u2019s first application for reinstatement. These reports described Dr. Corder as having an avoidant personality disorder and borderline and narcissistic personality traits, or a mixed personality disorder with avoidant and narcissistic traits, or an Axis II personality disorder.\n4. Dr. Jeffrey Waldman, in his report dated November 24, 2015, opined that with appropriate restrictions and limitations on Dr. Corder\u2019s license, the risk of repetition of the inappropriate boundary violations that resulted in the revocation of Dr. Corder\u2019s license, is low.\n5. Dr. Leonard Schwartz, Dr. Corder\u2019s treating psychiatrist, confirmed that he was continuing to see Dr. Corder for psychotherapy on a weekly basis when he (Dr. Corder) is in Manitoba. He noted that Dr. Corder continues to make progress in his individual therapy.\n6. Despite the progress made by Dr. Corder, the reports and assessments identify risks which could compromise patient safety and well-being in various circumstances. Therefore, Dr. Corder\u2019s second and current application for reinstatement to the Medical Register and for the reinstatement of his license to practice medicine in Manitoba, was denied.",

However, shortly thereafter, and unknown to the College until much later, Corder became involved in an exploitive sexual relationship with a patient.\n- Corder's license to practice medicine in Manitoba was revoked in June 2010 as a result of very serious professional misconduct on his part, involving two different female patients.\n- Corder entered pleas of guilty to the charges set forth in both Amended Notices of Inquiry, thereby acknowledging that the facts as alleged in the Notices of Inquiry were true and that those facts constituted either professional misconduct and\/or breaches of the By-laws of the College, and\/or the Code of Conduct of the College, and\/or a Statement of the College.\n- Corder is now seeking reinstatement of his license to practice medicine subject to three conditions: that he not conduct house calls, that he only examine female patients in the presence of a female attendant, and that he continue in a program of psychotherapy. CooDr. Corder had inappropriate relationships with two patients, referred to as Patient X and Patient Y.\nWith Patient X, Dr. Corder used her for sexual gratification. The specifics of these actions are not detailed in the document, but it is clear that the relationship was deemed inappropriate and a violation of professional boundaries.\nWith Patient Y, Dr. Corder formed an emotionally intimate relationship. After almost three years as Patient Y's primary care physician, Dr. Corder immediately entered into a close personal relationship with her. Although this relationship was not sexual, it was nonetheless inappropriate. Patient Y assumed the role of providing emotional support for Dr. Corder, which was deemed unacceptable due to the power imbalance inherent in the physician\/patient relationship.\nThese actions, along with warning signs of potential boundary violations in the early 1990s, suggested a long-standing pattern of behavior on the part of Dr. Corder that was of great concern to the Panel.",

The decision was released on August 10, 2022.\n\u2022 The case revolved around events that took place in 2019. The patient, with a complex medical history and at 37 weeks plus 5 days gestation, was admitted to the hospital for treatment of increased blood pressure.\n\u2022 Dr. Brown got involved with the patient's care on January 18, 2019. After several unsuccessful attempts to induce labor, Dr. Brown ordered a restart of the Oxytocin infusion. Later that day, the patient exhibited symptoms of chorioamnionitis (an inflammation of the fetal membranes due to a bacterial infection) and fetal tachycardia, indicating a need for urgent delivery.\n\u2022 Despite an abnormal fetal heart rate, Dr. Brown continued to increase the dosage of Oxytocin and did not arrange for urgent delivery. The patient began pushing to deliver the infant at 11:00 p.m., and Dr. Brown assessed the need for an urgent forceps delivery at 11:40 p.m.\n\u2022 The baby was delivered after midnight on January 19, with complications of shoulder dystocia. The infant did not survive despite immediate transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit for resuscitation.\n\u2022 The Tribunal found Dr. Brown guilty of professional misconduct due to her failure to appreciate the abnormal fetal heart tracing's significance, her lack of prompt action, and her overall care of the patient, which demonstrated gross negligence or reckless disregard for the patient and her infant.\n\u2022 The sanctions issued by the Tribunal included a reprimand, required completion of professional development courses covering \"appropriate management of labor and delivery\" and \"effective communication with patients\" within four months, and payment of the College's hearing costs in the fixed amount of $10,000.",

This decision was given on July 26, 2021.\n\u2022 The first complaint involved a conversation about gender reassignment with a patient in his clinic during a brief, unscheduled visit for methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). This conversation led to the patient removing his clothing and suffering physical discomfort from a method suggested by Dr. Maritz to conceal his genitals. The Tribunal found this interaction to be inappropriate and a violation of the patient's dignity and privacy.\n\u2022 The second, third, and fourth complaints related to Dr. Maritz's prescribing practices, particularly regarding MMT and opioids. The Tribunal found his practices to be non-standard and not adhering to relevant standards of practice, raising concerns by the provincial Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. This non-adherence included prescriptions being prepared long after patient encounters, absent documentation, and deficient record content.\n\u2022 Dr. Maritz acknowledged that he had not met the standard of practice in relation to his prescribing practices for methadone and other opioids. His practices included prescribing opioids to patients taking methadone, starting methadone at a high dose or increasing it rapidly, prescribing additional doses without question to traveling patients, and giving additional opioids when patients said they had run out or taken more than their prescribed dosage.\n\u2022 The fifth complaint concerned the same patient as the first complaint, and the Tribunal found Dr. Maritz's treatment and record-keeping practices were inadequate and not in full compliance with the College\u2019s Methadone Maintenance Treatment Standards and Guidelines.\n\u2022 The Tribunal accepted a joint submission on sanction and ordered that Dr. Maritz, who had already served a 21-month suspension, is eligible to apply for a medical licence as of the Tribunal\u2019s order date. He is also required to complete certain professional development courses at his cost, and his medical license will be restricted in specific ways when he returns to practice, including being prohibited indefinitely from prescribing narcotics, including opioids.\n\u2022 As a condition of his return to practice, Dr. Maritz must allow the College to oversee a chaperoning arrangement and pay the College's costs in the fixed amount of $10,000.",

Dr. Owolabi offered personal support outside of professional bounds, even offering to meet the patient for coffee and giving the patient his personal cell phone number.\nDr. Owolabi contacted the patient after the appointment and apologized for his inappropriate conduct. He also visited the patient's workplace attempting to speak with her, which the patient declined.\nDr. Owolabi's license at the time of these incidents required a chaperone to be present when seeing all female patients. However, during the appointments, no chaperone was present in the examination room. The patient was not aware of, and did not consent to, the chaperone\u2019s presence.\nThe Tribunal found Dr. Owolabi's conduct violated section 4(oo) of the College\u2019s Code of Ethics, which prohibits inappropriate comments or questions reflecting a lack of respect for the patient's dignity or privacy.\nThe Tribunal ordered a two-month suspension for Dr. Owolabi, following which his license will have restrictions that mandate a chaperone must be present in the examination room when providing medical care to female patients. This restriction will be in place for 24 months upon his return to the practice of medicine.\nBefore returning to practice, Dr. Owolabi must provide documentation outlining the terms and conditions of the chaperoning arrangement, in a format developed by the College.\nDr. Owolabi was ordered to pay the costs of the College in the amount of $5,000.",

The conditions included chaperone requirements, signage requirements, and restrictions on the circumstances surrounding Dr. Elves performing genital examinations.\n\nOn May 9, the Investigation Committee directed that Dr. Elves be formally disciplined by way of a censure and that a description of the circumstances that led to the censure be made available to the public. He was also ordered to pay the costs of the investigation in the amount of $4020.00.\n\nDr. Elves is permanently retiring from practicing medicine in June 2023 and signed an undertaking agreeing to refrain from practicing medicine in Manitoba or any other jurisdiction. He also agreed never to re-apply for licensure to practice medicine following his retirement. He will continue to be subject to terms and conditions on his practice until he retires on June 30, 2023.\n\nThe Registrar emphasized the importance of physicians approaching examinations with the utmost sensitivity, respect, and professionalism. Testicular and other genital examinations should be conducted in a manner that prioritizes patient comfort, privacy, and well-being. It is particularly important to communicate clearly and considerately with adolescent patients so that they understand the reasons for the examination and what it will entail before they can agree to the examination.",

He prescribed Ivermectin to the patient when he knew or ought to have known it was neither evidence-informed nor in the patient's best interest.\n- In the second case, Dr. Grobler failed to meet ethical and professional standards by not wearing a mask during a September 2021 clinical encounter with a patient under 18 years old. He allowed one of the patient's parents to remove their mask during the encounter without a valid reason at a time when mask-wearing was mandated. Dr. Grobler further conveyed information to the patient and their parents about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines that was contrary to Public Health recommendations, professional standards and expectations, and could pose a potential risk to personal and public safety.\n- CPSM became aware of concerns that Dr. Grobler was expressing views inconsistent with scientific evidence that contradicted Public Health recommendations about how COVID-19 is diagnosed, treated, and transmitted.\n- Dr. Grobler was asked to sign a voluntary undertaking in October 2020, stating he would not disseminate information to his patients or the public regarding COVID-19 that does not align with current public health directives. This undertaking remains in force and the conditions are posted on Dr. Grobler's public profile on CPSM's website. In this context, Dr. Grobler's conduct was considered in breach of his undertaking.\n- This case is a prime example of the dangers of misinformation to patient safety.",

When his suspension ended, he signed an undertaking to abide by those restrictions to permit his return to practice.\n- The allegations against Dr. Din were:\n- Breaching an undertaking signed with CPSM and breaching orders imposed by an Inquiry Panel, engaging in professional misconduct, unbecoming a member, and\/or contravening the Code of Ethics and\/or the Practice of Medicine Regulation.\n- Creating false and misleading medical records relating to the presence of a chaperone for 36 female patients to whom Dr. Din provided care to, thereby contravening the Code of Ethics.\n- Practicing beyond the boundaries of his certificate of practice in Family Medicine, which excluded providing medical care to pediatric patients (he provided care to patients under 18 years old whose identities were known to him) and thereby committed acts of professional misconduct, engaging in conduct unbecoming a member, and contravening the Practice of Medicine Regulation and\/or Code of Ethics.\n- Failing to maintain professional boundaries with Patient A, thereby violating his ethical obligations to that Patient and engaging in professional misconduct, engaging in conduct unbecoming a member, and contravening the Code of Ethics and the Standards of Practice of Medicine.\n- Displaying an unwillingness or inability to comply with the standards and meet the requirements of and\/or be governed by the CPSM and has thereby demonstrated an incapacity or unfitness to practice medicine.\n- The Inquiry Panel determined that Dr. Din is guilty on all 5 Counts.

The Panel ordered Dr. Din to pay $40,000 over four years and an additional $20,000 if he is reinstated to practice medicine.\n- The Registrar stated that Dr. Din's actions were irresponsible and reprehensible and that CPSM will not tolerate unethical practice. This also serves as a reminder that failing to maintain boundaries, falsifying documents, and breaching CPSM orders will not be tolerated. Unethical practice will result in severe consequences.",

X developed hematochezia at about 5 hours of age, and Dr. Elves ordered an abdominal x-ray and a CBC. Dr. Elves reviewed the x-ray with a radiologist and interpreted it as showing signs of a higher bowel obstruction, leading to a differential diagnosis that included obstruction such as atresia or obstruction for reasons of functional impairment. Dr. Elves' plan was to monitor the vitals, the obstruction, and any changes in the status. Another physician assumed X's care at approximately 20:00 on February 21, 2014, and X was transferred to Winnipeg. X had intestinal malrotation with volvulus, and by the time X arrived in Winnipeg, X had complete and irreversible intestinal necrosis and died at day four. Timely diagnosis of the intestinal malrotation with volvulus may have resulted in a greater chance of salvaging X's bowel.\n- Dr. Elves saw a baby named Y on referral for jaundice. The ultrasound of May 19th was reported as normal, but the liver enzymes and bilirubin test results continued to be abnormally high. Dr. Elves next saw Y on September 28, 2011, and noted that she needed a biopsy and a liver scan and that he attempted to contact the pediatric gastroenterology service by telephone on November 2, 2011, and afterward, but was unsuccessful. Another physician saw Y on November 10, 2011, for respiratory concerns and referred Y to Winnipeg for further investigations. In Winnipeg, Y was described as so jaundiced that she was literally green in colour, with florid cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The pediatric gastroenterologist made a provisional diagnosis of biliary atresia, for which bile duct surgery (Kasai procedure) by 2-3 months of age is the recommended treatment. However, Y was so ill that she was immediately transferred to Toronto where she was listed for life-saving liver transplantation. Timely diagnosis of biliary atresia may have avoided the necessity of Y's liver transplant.\n- The Investigation Committee records its disapproval of Dr. Elves' conduct in not meeting his professional responsibility to recognize his limitations and the competence of others and, given his limited experience with intestinal malrotation with volvulus and with biliary atresia, not promptly consulting colleagues for assistance and\/or referring X and Y for care.",
